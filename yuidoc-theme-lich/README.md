yuidoc-theme-blue
=================

a Simple theme inspired by the blue color for yuidoc (npm version)

Usage
=====

`````
npm i -g yuidoc
`````

- point to the theme directory

`````
yuidoc ./src -t /path/to/yuidoc-theme-blue
`````

Note
====

If you install yuidoc from this fork https://github.com/royriojas/yuidoc, then you will have another tag
`````
@exampleurl // points to a url that could be embeded in an iframe like this one http://jsfiddle.net/royriojas/ZuAhz/embedded/
`````

I needed that attribute to put examples on the methods and APIs that could be more like live examples of my API.
