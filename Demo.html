    Welcome to Lich.js!
    Lich.js is a new language for live coding music and graphics directly in a web browser. 
    This is a little demo page to give you an idea of what's possible. 
    The language isn't quite done yet (beta!), and there's still some bugs, but there is much fun to be had. 
    The syntax is similar to Haskell, but if you haven't used it, don't be scared. 


    If you want to get the source code or learn how to run your own server go to https://github.com/ChadMcKinney/Lich.js
    
    (If you want to chat with any other players you can use alt-c to enter chat messages)

-- Hacker Tip #1: Comments begin with --

-- Lets warm up with some math. Put your cursor on the next line and hold shift, then press enter. You should see 4 post.
2 + 2

-- Lich.js uses normal order of operations. For example, this will return 7:
1 + 2 * 3

-- The keyword let is used to declare variables at global scope. The next line defines monster as the string Cthulhu.
let monster = "Cthulhu"

-- Functions are evaluated simply by supplying arguments with spaces. 
reverse monster

-- New functions can be composed by using argument names after variable declarations, like so:
let addFive x = x + 5
addFive 1
addFive 2
addFive 1337


-- One last thing before we make some noise. Let's talk about partial application. 
-- Partial application is used heavily in Lich.js so it will be good to get used to it.
-- Normally a language requires you to supply all the arguments for a function for it to work. For example:
add 2 3 -- Evaluates to 5

-- In Haskell (and Lich) we can actually provide less than the expected number of arguments.
-- What will return is a new function expecting the rest of the arguments. For example:
add 2 -- Evaulates to (\r ->)
add -- Evaulates to (\l r ->)

-- We can assign this to variable and use it like any other function
let addTwo = add 2
addTwo 5 -- 7


-- This can be done with any function at all. Math operations are so common we have shortcuts
(/2) 4 -- 4 / 2 = 2
(*4) 3 -- 3 * 4 = 12
(3/) 6 -- 3 / 6 = 0.5
(4-) 2 -- 4 - 2 = 2

-- because of the haskell like syntax (-4) just means negative 4. We have to use subtract to get what we want. 
(subtract 4) 2 -- 2 - 4 = -2

-- If this is a bit confusing, don't worry, as you go through the examples you'll see how they're used and how useful they are!

-------------------------------------------------------------
-- OK. You came here for music right? Let's make some noise. 

let sineWave = play (sin 440)
stop sineWave -- when you've heard enough

-- Hacker Tip #2: Ctrl-Period will make all the sound stop. 
-- Sometimes you accidently make zombies. Ctrl-. is your nuclear option.

-- Lich.js makes it easy to get sound going and there's a large collection of custom functions to do just that. 
-- Evaluate the next line to see the collection of audio functions.
ugenList

-- Let's try another, how about something a bit more interesting?
let sawz = saw 40 >> lowpass 792 15 >> play
stop sawz

-- What's going on hear? We're using the >> operator to chain different functions together.
-- The >> operator just passes the left hand side to the function on the right. 
-- This is useful for audio because it makes function chains look like a signal path, like guitar pedals.
-- In the previous example we have a saw wave at 40hz fed into a lowpass filter with a cutoff of 792 hz and 15 for the res.
-- If you want to know what arguments a particular function has, just evaluate it with no arguments. For example:
lowpass

-- If you evaluation lowpass you will see this print: (\freq q input ->)

-- Ok This is fine and all but how about we make a melody?
-- First we need to make a synth definition, we'll use the new operator =>
let sawSynth freq => saw freq >> lowpass (freq * 16) 1 >> perc 0 0.3 0.7


-- Synth definitions are like functions, they can take arguments and can be evaluated like this:
play (sawSynth 440) -- You can evaluate this multiple times, it will free itself because of the perc above
sawSynth 440 >> play -- These are equivelent.

-- Now lets make a melody using a Solo Pattern
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 110 220 330 440 550 660 770 880
stop sawMelody

-- We can get a frequency as a degree from a scale by using the degree2Freq function
degree2Freq major 6
degree2Freq minor -2
d2f bartok 10 -- d2f is shorthand for degree2Freq.


-- Choose a scale degree in the bartok scale and play the sawSynth with it. in the Execute this several times.
sawSynth (d2f bartok (choose [-12..12])) >> play

-- to see a full list of scales evaulate the next line
scaleList

-- We can use modifiers on a sequence by using a |
-- After the pipe | we need to provide a function. 
-- Here we're creating a new function from d2f minor. Partial application FTW!
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | (d2f minor)

-- This isn't a terribly interesting melody. We can change it just be redefining it:
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 5 5 5 4 4 7 7 1 11 1 12 2 4 0 | (d2f minor)
stop sawMelody -- When you've heard enough


-- The ~> operator creates a new Solo Pattern. The first argument is a synth definition (sawSynth from above)
-- After that we get a list of numbers. The | pipe indicates that we want to use a modifier on these values.
-- The d2f function simply translates the numbers as scale degrees into frequencies in hz. 
-- If that's a bit too much, don't worry, just make your pattern look like above and you're in business.

-- This melody is a little fast, wouldn't it be nice if we could use rests in our melody?
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 5 5 5 _ 4 4 _ 7 7 _ 1 11 1 12 2 _ 4 0 _ | (d2f minor)

-- The _ is a rest, and no synth will be played on those beats. We can use [] to make faster notes:
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 0 1 2 3 [4 5] [6 7] | (d2f minor)

-- Note that there's no commas in these []. That's because we're using a special syntax, this is unique to these patterns. 
-- How about we mix _ and []
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 0 _ 1 2 3 [_ 4] [_ 5] [6 7] | (d2f minor)
stop sawMelody -- when you've heard enough



-- How about some drums?
-- We can make some very simple drums using the => again.
-- They don't need arguments for our purpose as you'll see.
-- Evaluate these lines one at a time.
let bd => square 39 >> lowpass 1000 0 >> perc 0 1 0.2
let sn => pink 1 >> perc 0 1 0.2
let hh => violet 1 >> perc 0 0.3 (wchoose [0.8,0.2] [0.1,0.5])

-- Now we can create an Impulse Pattern using the +> operator
drums +> bd hh sn hh


-- just like before we can edit them on the fly. Evaluating each line in turn will change the pattern
drums +> bd hh sn hh bd [hh hh] sn [hh sn]
drums +> [_ hh] hh
drums +> [bd bd]

-- We can use modifiers to change the durations. 
-- The | (*2) makes all the durations twice as long
drums +> bd hh sn hh bd [hh hh] sn [hh sn] | (*2)
drums +> bd hh sn hh bd [hh hh] sn [hh sn] -- back to normal

-- Hey, we can bring that melody back in
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 5 5 5 _ 4 4 _ 7 7 _ [1 11] [1 12] 4 0 _ 4 0 _ | (d2f minor)

-- OK what about some cool generative melody?
sawMelody ~> sawSynth (psin 0.1 >> prange 0 10) | (d2f minor)

-- Lets change it up more
sawMelody ~> sawSynth (psin 0.2 >> prange 0 10 >> pwarp (psin 0.7)) | (d2f minor)

-- how about some bass? 
-- HackerTip #3: Head phones or nicer speakers will make everything sound better
sawBass ~> sawSynth (psin 0.2 >> prange -2 -16 >> pstutter 14) | (d2f minor)

-- And some harmony?
sawHarmony ~> sawSynth (psaw 0.15 >> prange -2 5 >> pstutter 6)  | (d2f minor)

-- Break it down
drums +> bd hh sn hh [hh bd] [hh hh] sn [hh [sn sn]] | (*2)

-- When you've heard enough, compile these in turn
stop drums 
stop sawMelody
stop sawBass
stop sawHarmony


{-
    Pattern functions
    
    "p" functions are pattern functions. These functions return lambdas that when given a beat will return a value.
    Look over the code below to get a feel fro what the different pattern functions can do.
    Don't worry if you don't completely grok them yet. You'll get a feel for how to use them as you go.
-}


-- There are a plethora of special pattern functions in Lich. Evaluate the next line to see a list
patternList

-- Each pattern function takes some number of arguments and returns a Pattern data type object.
pseq [1,2,3] -- evaluates to: Pattern { p = (\t ->) }

-- A pattern object is simply a type wrapper for a function that takes a time argument and returns a value
-- For example we can assign the previous pattern to a value and then invoke that contained function to get a value.
let ps = pseq [0,1,2]
ps::p 0 -- 0
ps::p 1 -- 1
ps::p 2 -- 2
ps::p 3 -- 0, pseq will wrap around to the beginning
ps::p 4 -- 1

-- Lets look at another pattern function, pseries
let ps = pseries 1 2
ps::p 0 -- 1
ps::p 1 -- 3
ps::p 2 -- 5
ps::p 3 -- 7

-- Some pattern functions expect a pattern as one of their arguments.
-- We call these pattern filters. For example pstutter
let ps = pseries 1 2 >> pstutter 2
ps::p 0 -- 1
ps::p 1 -- 1
ps::p 2 -- 3
ps::p 3 -- 3
ps::p 4 -- 5
ps::p 5 -- 5

-- Here's some examples of using pattern functions to generate lists of values.
-- Normally we'd use pattern functions in solo streams or impulse streams like above
-- You'll see this soon, but the next several examples are just to give you some idea of what they can do.

-- Evaulate a sequence of values
let s = pseq [pseq [0,pseq [0.5, 666]], pseq [1,10], pseq [2,20]]
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (s::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- Random selections from array
let sh = prand [pseq [555,666,777], 1, 2]
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (sh::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- weighted random selections
let ws = pwrand [0.5, 0.25, 0.25] [pseq [555,666,777], 1, 2]
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (ws::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- shuffle array and return a pattern that sequences it
let ps = pshuf [0..4]
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (ps::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- a pattern filter. Stutters the output of a pattern
let st = pstutter 3 $ pseq [0..5]
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (st::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- Another pattern filter. Wraps a filter within a range
let pw = pwrap 3 6 (pseq [0..7])
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (pw::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- Generates a range of values from an initial value and step size
let ps = pseries 2 5
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (ps::p t)) [0] [0..12]

let ps = pwrap 0 13 $ pseries 0 2
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (ps::p t)) [0] [0..12]

-- Generates a range of values using multiplcation, from an initial value and step size
let pg = pgeom 1 2
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (pg::p t)) [0] [0..12]

let pg = pwrap 0 13 $ pgeom 1 2
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (pg::p t)) [0] [0..12]

let pr = preverse $ pseq [0..4]
foldl (\acc t -> acc ++ (pr::p t)) [0] [0..12]


-- Now normally you don't have to worry about using the ::p and supplying an argument
-- When using the patter functions in a pattern stream such as ~> and +> functions this will be done auto-magically
-- The next few example use patterns to generate values in ~> streams

let si freq => sin freq >> perc 0 0.3 0.15
siner ~> si (pseq [444,555,666,777])

siner ~> si (pseq [444,555,666,777] >> pstutter 3)

siner ~> si (pseq [444,555,666,777] >> pwarp (pseq [13.5, pseq [-5.3, 1]]))
stop siner

-- We can also use patterns with +> streams
-- Here we're using pattern function to select which synth definition to use

let s => sin 444 >> pan 0 >> perc 0 0.5 0.3
let s2 => sin 666 >> pan -1 >> perc 0 0.5 0.3
let s3 => sin 777 >> pan 1 >> perc 0 0.5 0.3
siner2 +> (pseq [s2,s3,s] >> pstutter 2)

siner2 +> (pseq [s,s3,s2] >> pwarp (pseq [(1/3),(1/4)])) | (/2)
stop siner2



{-
    beatPattern
    
    
    You can't use a pattern function such as pseq or pstutter inside a synthdef normally. 
    However by using the beatPattern function we can embed a pattern func in a synthdef, 
    and the value according to the current beat will be returned.
    
    For ease we can use bp instead of beatPattern.
-}

-- The beat based pattern functions using bp will update independant of the speed of the sequence.
-- This is because their values are based on the current beat number, this value is found by executing: currentBeat 0
-- If you evaluate currentBeat 0 several times you'll see the number it returns always rises according to the current tempo.
currentBeat 0

-- by using this current beat value with a pattern function we can get updated values

stop beatSynthesizer


{-
    pbind

    Above we've shown solo streams (~>) and impulse streams (+>), but there's a third kind of stream generator, pbind.
    
    pbind is similar to the SuperCollider Pbind and Pdef
    It takes: 
        a pattern name (used to store in a global dictionary for updates via redefinition)
        a synth definition (can be a pattern of synth definitions)
        an array of arguments (each argument can be a pattern)
        and a duration (can be pattern)
        
    
    pbind name synthDef arguments duration

let t f dur => sin (d2f slendro f) >> pan -1 >> perc 0 0.5 (dur * 1.5)
let u f dur => sin (d2f slendro f) >> pan 1 >> perc 0 0.5 (dur * 1.5)

-- pbind name synthDef arguments duration
let testp = pbind "test" t [5, dur] dur

let mc = Chord minor 4

-- chordProgression returns a pbind that just sequences through the chords. They can be queried using ::value
let doom = chordProgression "doom" [mc [0,2,4], mc [1,3,5], mc [2,4,6], mc [3,5,7], mc [4,6,8], mc [5,7,9]] [8] 

let synth freq => saw freq >> lowpass (freq * 4) 1 >> perc 0 0.6 0.5

-- We can use the progression similar to a scale, with c2f instead of d2f. c2f takes a scale and a chord degree.
-- The chord degree can be any integer including negative numbers and will scale octaves appropriately

-- We can create buffer by using the newBuffer function
let myBuf = newBuffer sampleRate

-- You can use buffers with the recPlayBuf ugen. This will simultaneously record into and play from a buffer, at variable rates

    We can route audio using the auxIn and auxOut ugens
    By default there are 10 global aux buses, but you can also create local buses.
