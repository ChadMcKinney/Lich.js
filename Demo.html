{-
    Welcome to Lich.js!
    Lich.js is a new language for live coding music and graphics directly in a web browser. 
    This is a little demo page to give you an idea of what's possible. 
    The language isn't quite done yet, and there's still some bugs, but there is much fun to be had. 
    The syntax is similar to Haskell, but if you haven't used it, don't be scared.

-- Hacker Tip #1: Comments begin with --

-- Lets warm up with some math. Put your cursor on the next line and hold shift, then press enter. You should see 4 post.
2 + 2

-- Lich.js uses normal order of operations. For example, this will return 7:
1 + 2 * 3

-- The keyword let is used to declare variables at global scope. The next line defines monster as the string Cthulhu.
let monster = "Cthulhu"

-- Functions are evaluated simply by supplying arguments with spaces. 
reverse monster

-- New functions can be composed by using argument names after variable declarations, like so:
let addFive x = x + 5
addFive 1
addFive 2
addFive 1337


-- OK. You came here for music right? Let's make some noise. 
let sineWave = play (sin 440)
stop sineWave -- when you've heard enough

-- Hacker Tip #2: Ctrl-Period will make all the sound stop. 
-- Sometimes you accidently make zombies. Ctrl-. is your nuclear option.

-- Lich.js makes it easy to get sound going and there's a large collection of custom functions to do just that. 
-- Evaluate the next line to see the collection of audio functions.
ugenList

-- Let's try another, how about something a bit more interesting?
let sawz = saw 40 >> lowpass 792 15 >> play
stop sawz

-- What's going on hear? We're using the >> operator to chain different functions together.
-- The >> operator just passes the left hand side to the function on the right. 
-- This is useful for audio because it makes function chains look like a signal path, like guitar pedals.
-- In the previous example we have a saw wave at 40hz fed into a lowpass filter with a cutoff of 792 hz and 15 for the res.
-- If you want to know what arguments a particular function has, just evaluate it with no arguments. For example:
lowpass

-- If you evaluation lowpass you will see this print: (\freq q input ->)

-- Ok This is fine and all but how about we make a melody?
-- First we need to make a synth definition, we'll use the new operator =>
let sawSynth freq => saw freq >> lowpass (freq * 16) 1 >> perc 0 0.3 0.7


-- Synth definitions are like functions, they can take arguments and can be evaluated like this:
play (sawSynth 440) -- You can evaluate this multiple times, it will free itself because of the perc above
sawSynth 440 >> play -- These are equivelent.

-- Now lets make a melody using a Solo Pattern
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | (d2f minor)

-- This isn't a terribly interesting melody. We can change it just be redefining it:
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 5 5 5 4 4 7 7 1 11 1 12 2 4 0 | (d2f minor)
stop sawMelody -- When you've heard enough


-- The ~> operator creates a new Solo Pattern. The first argument is a synth definition (sawSynth from above)
-- After that we get a list of numbers. The | pipe indicates that we want to use a modifier on these values.
-- The d2f function simply translates the numbers as scale degrees into frequencies in hz. 
-- If that's a bit too much, don't worry, just make your pattern look like above and you're in business.

-- This melody is a little fast, wouldn't it be nice if we could use rests in our melody?
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 5 5 5 _ 4 4 _ 7 7 _ 1 11 1 12 2 _ 4 0 _ | (d2f minor)

-- The _ is a rest, and no synth will be played on those beats. We can use [] to make faster notes:
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 0 1 2 3 [4 5] [6 7] | (d2f minor)

-- Note that there's no commas in these []. That's because we're using a special syntax, this is unique to these patterns. 
-- How about we mix _ and []
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 0 _ 1 2 3 [_ 4] [_ 5] [6 7] | (d2f minor)
stop sawMelody -- when you've heard enough



-- How about some drums?
-- We can make some very simple drums using the => again.
-- They don't need arguments for our purpose as you'll see.
-- Evaluate these lines one at a time.
let bd => square 39 >> lowpass 1000 0 >> perc 0 1 0.2
let sn => pink 1 >> perc 0 1 0.2
let hh => violet 1 >> perc 0 0.3 (wchoose [0.8,0.2] [0.1,0.5])

-- Now we can create an Impulse Pattern using the +> operator
drums +> bd hh sn hh


-- just like before we can edit them on the fly. Evaluating each line in turn will change the pattern
drums +> bd hh sn hh bd [hh hh] sn [hh sn]
drums +> [_ hh] hh
drums +> [bd bd]

-- We can use modifiers to change the durations. 
-- The | (*2) makes all the durations twice as long
drums +> bd hh sn hh bd [hh hh] sn [hh sn] | (*2)
drums +> bd hh sn hh bd [hh hh] sn [hh sn] -- back to normal

-- Hey, we can bring that melody back in
sawMelody ~> sawSynth 5 5 5 _ 4 4 _ 7 7 _ [1 11] [1 12] 4 0 _ 4 0 _ | (d2f minor)

-- OK what about some cool generative melody?
sawMelody ~> sawSynth (psin 0.1 >> prange 0 10) | (d2f minor)

-- Lets change it up more
sawMelody ~> sawSynth (psin 0.2 >> prange 0 10 >> pwarp (psin 0.7)) | (d2f minor)

-- how about some bass? 
-- HackerTip #3: Head phones or nicer speakers will make everything sound better
sawBass ~> sawSynth (psin 0.2 >> prange -2 -16 >> pstutter 14) | (d2f minor)

-- And some harmony?
sawHarmony ~> sawSynth (psaw 0.15 >> prange -2 5 >> pstutter 6)  | (d2f minor)

-- Break it down
drums +> bd hh sn hh [hh bd] [hh hh] sn [hh [sn sn]] | (*2)

-- When you've heard enough, compile these in turn
stop drums 
stop sawMelody
stop sawBass
stop sawHarmony
