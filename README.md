USAGE
=====

At the moment Lich.js is not officially released. If you still want to try it out you can get it up and running on your own computer but it will require a little work. There are still bugs, missing features, and essentially no documentation so don't expect a finished product. All that said, here are the instructions to try out Lich.js for yourself.

Lich.js is divided into two parts: a server and a client. To create a server you will first need Node.js installed on your computer. Node can be found here: http://nodejs.org/. If you're on Linux it should likely be in your standard repo, for instance in Ubuntu you can install it with: 
<!--- The ```bash and ``` at the end is for markdown rendering. Please ignore if you're reading this from a text editor or the like. -->
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

Next you will need to use npm (node package manager) to install socket.io (a networking library) to the Lich.js local directory. In a unix based system (Linux/OSX) you can use the command line to do this as such:

``` bash
cd /path/to/lich.js
npm install socket.io
```

At this point you have all the dependancies for the server. Now you can just run this from the command line to get the server up (this should be run from the lich.js folder):

```bash
sudo node Networking/LichServer.js
```

Now all that's left is to open up Chrome (Firefox and Safari also work, but not as well) and go to 127.0.0.1 (or if you're doing this on a different computer, say your server, just point your browser at that computer's IP). Once the page has loaded you can test that everything is running by executing this code (use shift-return to execute a line of code) :

<!--- the ```haskell is for markdown rendering such as on GitHub. If you're reading this document via a text editor please ignore the ```haskell and the ``` at the end. -->
```haskell
let testSynth freq => saw freq >> perc 0 0.2 0.3
testPattern ~> testSynth 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | (d2f major)

-- When you've heard enough
stop testPattern
```
